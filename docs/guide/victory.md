# 🏆 Victory Conditions - Complete Guide

In Sumer Wars there are **two possible end‑game victory paths**. Each demands a different alliance doctrine and months of coordinated preparation.

## 🏗️ Option 1: Ziggurat of Eternity {#ziggourat}

### 🗿 Concept
The **Ziggurats of Eternity** are mythical world-wonders that can only be erected on **special neutral sites** scattered in strategic positions across the world map.

### 📍 Neutral Sites
**Count:** 3–5 per server (size dependent)  
**Location Patterns:**
- Junctions of major rivers
- Strategic geographic centers  
- High‑traffic trade crossroads
- Never near player spawn clusters

**Characteristics:**
- **Neutral territory** – no terrain bonuses
- **Open contest** – any player/alliance may attempt to seize it
- **Natural defenses** – powerful guardian monsters (they respawn/regenerate)

### 🏗️ Construction Process

#### Phase 1: Seizure (1–4 weeks)
1. **Clear guardians** (multiple coordinated battles)
2. **Establish a permanent military foothold** on the tile  
3. **Secure a defensive perimeter** vs rival alliances
4. **Deploy core infrastructure** (storage, fortifications, logistics)

#### Phase 2: Monument Build (2–3 real months)
**10 sequential levels must be completed**

| Levels | Build Time (each) | Total Cost (per level) | Special Conditions |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 1–2 | 7 days | 100k of each resource | Basic defense pressure |
| 3–4 | 10 days | 250k + 100 Divine Tears | First organized assaults begin |
| 5–6 | 14 days | 500k + 300 Divine Tears | Peak enemy siege intensity |
| 7–8 | 18 days | 1M + 500 Divine Tears | Maximum coordination required |
| 9–10 | 21 days | 2M + 1000 Divine Tears | Ultimate sustained defense |

#### Phase 3: Sanctification (30 consecutive days)
- **Unbroken 24/7 defense** for 30 days after level 10 finishes
- **Any successful breach** resets the 30‑day timer
- **Victory is declared** if the full period elapses without a successful enemy capture

### 🛡️ Defensive Doctrine

#### 🏰 Multi‑Layer Fortification
1. **Outer screen** – watchtowers, patrol detachments
2. **Middle ring** – heavy walls + static garrisons
3. **Core redoubt** – elite troops + heroes + summoned creatures
4. **Mobile reserves** – rapid reaction strike forces

#### ⚡ Active Defense
- **Shift rotations** – time‑zone handoffs for uninterrupted coverage
- **Emergency reinforcement protocol** – automated alliance alert pings
- **Preemptive counter‑raids** – disrupt staging bases & logistics
- **Attrition warfare** – drain attacker stockpiles and morale

### 🗡️ Offensive Doctrine (Attacking a Ziggurat)

#### 📊 Target Recon
- **Defensive level** – scout visible fortifications & troop comps
- **Defender activity cycle** – uptime windows, coordination speed
- **Sustain capacity** – can they withstand a long siege?
- **External backing** – vassal or ally alliances ready to reinforce

#### ⚔️ Siege Tactics
- **Total blockade** – sever supply caravans & reinforcement routes
- **Synchronized waves** – multi‑front saturation to overload response
- **Psychological pressure** – morale bleed via constant minor probes
- **Internal subversion** – espionage, bribery, engineered defections

## 🐉 Option 2: Tiamat the Primordial {#tiamat}

### 🌊 Emergence
**Timing:** After 6+ months on a mature server  
**Trigger:** Automatic global event once conditions are met:
- At least 5 alliances with 50+ active members
- Advanced tier technologies unlocked
- Power balance (no single absolute hegemon)

### 🐲 Battle Phases

#### Phase 1: Awakening (1 week)
- **Forewarning events** – tremors, omens, mythic portents
- **Gradual manifestation** – Tiamat breaches into a central zone
- **Positioning** – alliances maneuver & stage forward bases

#### Phase 2: First Engagements (2–3 weeks)
- **Colossal HP pool** – several million hit points
- **Regeneration** – heals 10% HP per day if not attacked
- **Area devastation** – can obliterate entire cities in an attack cycle
- **Cycling immunities** – rotating resistances to damage types/attack classes

#### Phase 3: Final Clash (≈1 week)
- **Critical threshold** – below 25% HP rage begins
- **Cataclysmic wrath** – server‑wide punitive strikes
- **Finish race** – alliances dump everything in all‑in assaults
- **Victory credit** – alliance dealing the final 10% cumulative damage

### 🤝 Forced Cooperation Mechanics

#### 🎯 Measured Contribution
- **Damage dealt** – granular tracking per player & alliance
- **Logistical support** – resources funnelled, heroes loaned
- **Active presence time** – participation windows in major assaults

#### 🏅 Proportional Rewards
**Victorious alliance (>40% total contribution):**
- Official Server Victor status
- Permanent monuments commemorating the feat
- Exclusive bonus advantages on the next seasonal server

**Participating alliances (>10% contribution):**
- Significant Divine Tears rewards
- Unlocks of exclusive late‑era technologies
- Community prestige & diplomatic leverage

#### ⚔️ Anti‑Cooperation Maneuvers
Some alliances may attempt to:
- **Monopolize Tiamat** – gatekeep participation & timing
- **Sabotage** – strike rivals mid‑engagement
- **Timing manipulation** – let others grind HP then snipe phases

## 📈 Long‑Term Preparation

### 🏗️ For the Ziggurat (Builder Alliance)
**6+ months out:**
- Identify, scout & chart candidate sites
- Hyper‑scale shared economic core  
- Complete every construction & defense technology
- Forge durable diplomatic pacts

**3 months out:**
- Stockpile colossal multi‑resource reserves
- Form a permanent defensive corps (500+ active accounts rostered)
- Finalize 24/7 rotation & command structure  
- Pre‑position siege logistics (supplies, reinforcement corridors)

### 🐉 For Tiamat (Combat Alliance)
**Research priority:**
- Anti‑monster tech lines (+50% damage vs Creatures)  
- Specialized anti‑boss heroes (resist builds, support spells)
- Elite summoned entities (Giant Scorpions, Spirits, Colossi)

**Optimal army mix (baseline):**
- 40% Immortals (resist heavy AoE)
- 30% Master Archers (sustained ranged DPS)  
- 20% Royal Chariots (burst charge impact)
- 10% Heroes & special summoned units

## 💡 Strategic Guidance

### 🎯 Path Selection
::: tip Ziggurat – Suited for Alliances that are:
- **Highly organized** – disciplined command & logistics
- **Defensive‑minded** – comfortable with patience & attrition
- **Wealthy** – economy robust enough for marathon funding
- **Dominant** – already projecting regional map control
:::

::: info Tiamat – Suited for Alliances that are:  
- **Aggressive** – prefer active military campaigning
- **Mobile** – excel at rapid redeployment & adaptation
- **Coalition‑capable** – can unify multiple mid‑tier allies
- **Challenger status** – trailing current hegemon(s) but organized
:::

### ⚖️ Endgame Diplomacy
- **Ziggurat:** Negotiate non‑aggression pacts during build phase
- **Tiamat:** Forge temporary coalitions vs dominant blocs
- **Espionage:** Intelligence on enemy staging is decisive
- **Defections:** Engineer last‑minute betrayal opportunities

::: warning Warning
Server victory is never secure until the final trigger. Even the largest alliances have collapsed days before triumph through complacency or internal treachery.

::: tip Final Counsel
*"Victory belongs not to the strongest, but to the most relentlessly cohesive. In Sumer Wars it is the alliance that stays united to the last dawn that carves its name into eternity."*
