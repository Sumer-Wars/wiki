# 🌊 River System - Complete Guide

The **river system** is the defining strategic layer that sets Sumer Wars apart from other MMORTS titles. Master the rivers, master Mesopotamia.

## 💎 Strategic Advantages of Rivers

### 🌾 Agricultural Production Bonuses
- **+30% Wheat production** for Irrigated Fields adjacent to rivers
- **+30% Clay production** for Clay Pits on banks
- These bonuses are **permanent** and stack with technologies

### 🚢 Rapid Transport
- **Doubled movement speed** for river units
- **High transport density** (one Light Boat = 20 land unit slots equivalent)
- **Discreet movement** – harder for enemies to detect early

### 💰 Preferred Trade Lanes
- **50% reduced transport cost** along rivers
- **Faster exchange cycles** between your settlements
- **Access to rare imports** like Wood

## 🏰 Riverine Territorial Control

### 🛡️ River Fortresses
Build **Shipyards** at strategic nodes:
- **Confluences** – Control multiple waterways at once
- **Chokepoints** – Deny hostile passage
- **Deltas** – Dominate outlets toward the sea

### 🚧 Blockade Mechanics
With naval superiority you can:
- **Deny passage** to enemy ships
- **Tax enemy trade** (10% of transported resources)
- **Control access** to fishing & exploration zones

### 💸 Trade Taxation
When you control a river segment:
- **5% tax** on all enemy commercial shipments
- **Passive income** in Gold & mixed resources  
- **Economic intelligence** – visibility of trade flow

## ⚔️ River Domination Strategy

### 🎯 Phase 1: Establishment (Days 1-30)
1. **Identify the nearest river** to your starting city
2. **Build production structures** along banks for immediate bonuses
3. **Place your first Shipyard** as soon as tech / level allows (Lv.5)
4. **Recruit 3–5 Light Boats** for mapping & scouting

### 🎯 Phase 2: Expansion (Days 30-60) 
1. **Scout upstream & downstream** to chart the full course
2. **Locate strategic confluences** and choke narrows
3. **Found a colony** at a control nexus
4. **Build your first War Barge** for deterrence

### 🎯 Phase 3: Domination (Days 60+)
1. **Assemble a war fleet** (5+ Assault Ships, 10+ Barges)
2. **Set layered blockades** on hostile passages
3. **Coordinate alliance coverage** for full control of a major river
4. **Exploit economically** via taxation & privileged trade lanes

## 🗺️ River Types & Strategy

### 🏔️ Mountain River
**Traits:** Fast, narrow, defensible  
**Strategy:** Hold chokepoints, secure bonus copper nodes  
**Recommended Units:** Assault Ships for reactive defense

### 🌾 Plains River  
**Traits:** Wide, navigable, highly productive  
**Strategy:** Intensive agriculture & mass logistics  
**Recommended Units:** Light Boats for bulk rotation

### 🏜️ Delta River
**Traits:** Multi‑branch, complex, rich deposits  
**Strategy:** Multi‑node control & international trade hub  
**Recommended Units:** War Barges for patrol grids

## 💡 Recommended Fleet Compositions

### 🛡️ Defensive Fleet "Guardian"
- **3 Assault Ships** (naval combat)
- **2 War Barges** (support artillery)  
- **5 Light Boats** (mobility & recon)

**Use:** Defend critical river segment  
**Cost:** Moderate, low upkeep

### ⚔️ Offensive Fleet "Conqueror"
- **5 Assault Ships** (naval superiority)
- **8 War Barges** (firepower core)
- **10 Light Boats** (troop lift)

**Use:** Seize additional river zones  
**Cost:** High, significant upkeep

### 💰 Trade Fleet "Merchant"
- **1 Assault Ship** (escort)
- **3 War Barges** (convoy shield)
- **15 Light Boats** (resource lift)

**Use:** Secure commercial throughput  
**Cost:** Efficient logistics, high profit margin

## 🎯 Alliance Strategic Objectives

### 🏆 Major River Control
**Goal:** Fully dominate a principal server river  
**Advantages:**
- Massive taxation revenue
- Enemy supply disruption  
- Dominant staging axis for endgame victory

### 🌊 Integrated River Network
**Goal:** Connect multiple rivers through allied corridors  
**Advantages:**
- Continent‑scale rapid transport
- Simplified joint military timing
- Integrated alliance economy

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

::: warning Beginner Errors
- **Ignoring rivers** – forfeits ~30% economic potential
- **Building inland** – forfeits adjacency bonuses
- **Neglecting naval defense** – trade lanes get severed
- **Underestimating river assaults** – attacks arrive 2× faster
:::

::: danger Costly Errors  
- **Overextension** – Holding too many segments without fleet density
- **Uncoordinated naval war** – Solo fights vs organized alliances
- **Ignoring upkeep** – Fleet drain cripples economy over time
:::

## 🏅 Advanced Mastery

### 🎨 Feints & Diversions
- **Fake land offensive** while main force ascends river
- **Phantom blockade** to force enemy fleet splitting
- **Trade snooping** – leverage boats as disguised recon

### 🧠 Economic Warfare
- **Selective blockade** – sever only critical enemy inputs
- **Price shaping** – restrict supply to inflate market rates
- **Route denial** – force opponents onto slow land paths
