# 🔬 Technology Tree

The **Scribes' School** defines your city's strategic direction. The tree has been **compressed into mutually exclusive branches** that force meaningful specialization (Economy, Military, Religious, Logistics, Trade). No single city can efficiently master everything—distribute roles across colonies and alliance members.

## 🏫 Scribes' School Progression
| Level | Research Queue Slots | Speed Bonus | Unlock |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | 1 | - | Access Tier 1 branch roots |
| 3 | 1 | +5% | Pick first Specialization (Primary) |
| 5 | 2 | +10% | Access Tier 2 of chosen branch |
| 7 | 2 | +15% | Optional second Specialization (Secondary) |
| 9 | 3 | +20% | Access Tier 3 (branch ultimates) |
| 12 | 3 | +25% | Alliance Technologies |

> Hard cap: **Maximum 2 specializations per city**. Beginning research of a 3rd T2+ branch applies a temporary global **−30% research speed** penalty (anti omni-build deterrent).

## 🏭 City Specialization Archetypes
| City Type | Suggested Branches | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Economic Capital | Production + Logistics | Global growth & distribution hub |
| Fortress | Infantry + Religious | Defense + hero / tear amplification |
| Main Port | River + Trade | River control & trade throughput |
| Raid Outpost | Infantry + Logistics | Projection speed & frequent raids |

> Spread Tier 3 unlocks across different cities for **higher compounded returns** and reduced catastrophic loss risk.

## 🎯 Sample Progression (Economic Capital)
1. Writing → Sundial → Pick Production
2. Selective Irrigation → Granary Tallying → Crop Rotation
3. Push School 5 → Standardized Carts (secondary Logistics) → Paved Roads
4. Prepare Managed Growth before large military expansion

## ⚖️ Exclusive Mechanics & Limiters
- Each NEW Tier 2 branch started increases the base cost of the next fresh Tier 2 by +10% (anti wide rush)
- All Tier 3 require School 9 (planned investment spike)
- Versatility penalty (−30% speed) discourages a 3rd advanced spec in one city

## 💡 Tips
::: tip Optimization
- Keep a research slot active (queue shorter techs overnight)
- Centralize Trade functions in one hub to avoid diluted bonuses
- Trigger Collective Genius right before a wave of Tier 3 researches
:::

::: warning Pitfalls
- Rushing military Tier 3 without a stable economy
- Neglecting Logistics slows every strategic plan
- Duplicating identical specializations on all cities (lost synergy)
